# C Piscine

Here's some exercises covered during my C Piscine at 42 Quebec.

## Why
I believe it's easier to understand something by trying to implement it and figuring out why it work.

For me, learning how to code is the same thing as learning how to draw. At first, you will probably need some references, but with practice, you will be able to create something made all by your own mind.

## Notice
If some 42 students sneak around here, please keep in mind that cheating (not understanding) won't help you in the long run. 

## How to make it work
Each folder of C have 2 c files, one containing the function, the other, the main file that call the function.
In the command line, you will need to call both of them to check the result in the ./a.out file.
**Don't forget to call -Wall -Werror -Wextra and the norminette !**
```
gcc function.c main.c
```
**To see the result :**
```
./a.out
```
