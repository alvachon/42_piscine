# C Piscine

Here's some exercices covered during my C Piscine at 42 Quebec.

## Why
I believe it's easier to understand something by trying to implement it and figuring out why it work.

For me, learning how to code is the same thing as learning how to draw. At first, you will probably need some references, but with practice, you will be able to create something made all by your own mind.

## Notice
If some 42 students sneak around here, please keep in mind that cheating (not understanding) won't help you in the long run.
